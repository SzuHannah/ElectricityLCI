# Electricity Life Cycle Inventory

A Python package that uses standardized facility releases and generation data to create regionalized life cycle inventory (LCI) models for the generation, mix of generation, mix of consumption, and distribution of electricity to end users for the US, with embedded system processes of upstream fuel production and infrastructure.
Pre-configured model specifications are included (in the modelconfig directory of the package install: electricitylci/modelconfig) or users can specify their own models by creating new configuration YAML files in the modelconfig directory.
The created LCI models are exported for use in standard life cycle assessment software (i.e., in JSON-LD format using the openLCA v2.0 schema).

This code was created as part of a collaboration between US EPA Office of Research and Development (USEPA) and the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) with contributions from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and support from Eastern Research Group (ERG).
More information on this effort can be found in the [Framework for an Open-Source Life Cycle Baseline for Electricity Consumption in the United States](https://netl.doe.gov/energy-analysis/details?id=4004).

# API
In the latest version of ElectricityLCI, there is a dependency on three external datasets that require the use of an application programming interface (API) key.
These keys are free to request and assist their governing agencies with reporting and justifying their data service.

The EPA's Continuous Emissions Monitors (CEMs) background data are provided by the Clean Air Markets API Portal.
Request a free API key (a long string of numbers used to unlock data access) at the following site.
Keep your API key secret, as it links you to the their data.

- https://www.epa.gov/power-sector/cam-api-portal#/api-key-signup

The EIA's bulk U.S. Electric System Operating Data (EBA) is provided by their Open Data API (v2).
Request a free API key by registering at the following address.

- https://www.eia.gov/opendata/.

NETL's coal transportation inventory update is provided through a public URL on [EDX](https://edx.netl.doe.gov), found within the [Life Cycle Analysis](https://edx.netl.doe.gov/group/life-cycle-analysis) group.
An automated download of the Excel workbook will trigger a request for an EDX API key.
API keys require registration.

- https://edx.netl.doe.gov/user/register

Non-government users are required to list a point of contact for registration.
Please raise as an issue on this GitHub repository to request this additional information.

Be careful when the ElectricityLCI prompts you for an API key, as there are three you need to keep track of (EDX, EPA and EIA).
For convenience, the API keys may be stored in the configuration YAML files in the `epa_cam_api`, `eia_api`, and `edx_api` parameters.
Make sure you paste the right ones!

# Use
Check which eLCI model configuration you want to use, or create a new configuration.
To show the location of the YAML files, run the following:

```py
>>> from electricitylci.globals import get_config_dir
>>> get_config_dir()
'~/ElectricityLCI/electricitylci/modelconfig'
```

The output string may be copied to File Explorer or Finder address bar.

To run the installed package from the terminal/command line:

```sh
$ python -m electricitylci.main
```

## State-level Brightway workflow

The repository now ships with a non-interactive helper that builds and
imports state-level LCIs directly into Brightway25.  The workflow is exposed
through :mod:`electricitylci.state_brightway` and relies on the new
``ELCI_STATE`` configuration (``electricitylci/modelconfig/ELCI_STATE_config.yml``).

```py
from electricitylci.state_brightway import (
    generate_state_inventory,
    import_state_inventory_to_brightway,
    compute_traci_impacts,
)

# 1. Build the state-aggregated generation and mix processes
state_run = generate_state_inventory()

# 2. Import the JSON-LD archive into a Brightway project
import_state_inventory_to_brightway(state_run["jsonld"], project_name="ELCI-States")

# 3. Evaluate TRACI v2.1 impact scores for a specific state
scores = compute_traci_impacts(
    database="ELCI_STATE",
    region="CA",
    methods=[("TRACI 2.1", "Total", "global warming")],
)
```

The helper functions automatically install the TRACI v2.1 LCIA package using
``bw2io`` when it is not already available.  Make sure the required API keys
are populated in ``ELCI_STATE_config.yml`` before running the workflow.

### Running the state workflow on Google Colab

The helper module can be executed end-to-end in a Colab notebook so long as the
runtime has enough disk space (≈3 GB) and an active internet connection for the
dataset downloads.  The outline below assumes a new Colab notebook with a
Python 3 runtime:

1. **Install the dependencies** – Colab instances do not persist packages
   across sessions, so start each notebook with the required installations.  The
   snippet below installs Brightway, ElectricityLCI, and the supporting
   libraries:

   ```python
   !pip install -q git+https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List
   !pip install -q git+https://github.com/USEPA/standardizedinventories
   !pip install -q scipy brightway25
   !pip install -q git+https://github.com/USEPA/ElectricityLCI.git
   ```

2. **Create the configuration file** – Copy the packaged
   ``ELCI_STATE_config.yml`` to a writable location (for example, Colab’s working
   directory) and add your API keys.  Using `pkgutil.get_data` avoids manual file
   uploads:

   ```python
   from pathlib import Path
   import pkgutil

   config_path = Path.cwd() / "ELCI_STATE_config.yml"
   if not config_path.exists():
       data = pkgutil.get_data("electricitylci", "modelconfig/ELCI_STATE_config.yml")
       config_path.write_bytes(data)

   # TODO: replace the placeholder strings with your actual keys.
   text = config_path.read_text()
   text = text.replace("your-edx-api-key", "<EDX_KEY>")
   text = text.replace("your-eia-api-key", "<EIA_KEY>")
   text = text.replace("your-epa-api-key", "<EPA_KEY>")
   config_path.write_text(text)
   ```

3. **Point ElectricityLCI to the edited configuration** – Override the default
   model directory so the helper picks up the Colab-local configuration:

   ```python
   import electricitylci.model_config as model_config

   model_config.config_directory = str(Path.cwd())
   ```

4. **Run the workflow** – Import the helper functions, generate the state-level
   inventory, and push it into a Brightway project.  The example below writes the
   TRACI v2.1 scores for California; adjust the region or methods as needed:

   ```python
   from electricitylci.state_brightway import (
       generate_state_inventory,
       import_state_inventory_to_brightway,
       compute_traci_impacts,
   )

   run = generate_state_inventory()
   import_state_inventory_to_brightway(run["jsonld"], project_name="ELCI-States", overwrite=True)
   scores = compute_traci_impacts(
       database="ELCI_STATE",
       region="CA",
       methods=[("TRACI 2.1", "Total", "global warming")],
   )
   scores
   ```

5. **Download the JSON-LD archive (optional)** – Colab stores generated files in
   `/content`.  To use the inventory outside Colab, download the archive produced
   in step 4:

   ```python
   from google.colab import files

   files.download(run["jsonld"])
   ```

If you encounter HTTP 403 errors while running the notebook, double-check that
the API keys in ``ELCI_STATE_config.yml`` are valid and that the corresponding
services have been activated for your account.

To run in a Python interpreter from within a cloned repository:

```py
>>> exec(open("electricitylci/main.py").read())
```

The `main()` method has four steps:

1. `build_model_config()`
    - Prompts the user to select one of the model configurations.
    - The 2016 baseline configurations are:
        * ELCI_1
        * ELCI_2
        * ELCI_3
    - Version 2 baselines include:
        * ELCI_2020
        * ELCI_2021
        * ELCI_2022
    - These configurations statically change the module, model_config.py, which is an object read by other modules.
    - To change configuration values, edit the YAML before running the code.
2. `run_generation()`
    - Pulls upstream inventories for coal, natural gas, petroleum, nuclear, and plant construction
    - Creates generation processes
        * Optionally includes renewables (e.g., geothermal, wind, solar PV, solar thermal, and hydroelectric)
        * Optionally includes plant water use
        * Adds Canadian mixes
        * Aggregates to regions of interest (e.g., balancing authority areas or FERC regions)
3. `run_distribution(gen_data, gen_dict)`
    - Creates the at-grid generation mix processes
    - Creates the at-grid consumption mix processes (following one of two trade models)
    - Creates the at-user consumption mix processes (based on calculated transmission and distribution losses)
4. `run_post_processes()`
    - Cleans the JSON-LD files (e.g., removing zero-value product flows, removing untracked flows, correcting flow categories, and creating consecutive internal exchange IDs)
    - Builds the product systems for balancing authority areas, FERC regions, and US.

# Known Issues
See Appendix A in [this discussion](https://github.com/USEPA/ElectricityLCI/discussions/288) for an overview of unresolved issues in version 2.

# Troubleshooting
If you receive a TypeError in `write_jsonld`, got unexpected keyword argument 'zw', then it's likely you have an outdated version of [fedelemflowlist](https://github.com/USEPA/fedelemflowlist).
Please ensure these USEPA packages are up-to-date:

- esupy
- fedelemflowlist
- stewi

If GitHub-hosted packages fail to clone and install, manually downloading the zip files, extracting them, and running the pip install command within package folder also works (see snippet below for example for older version of fedelemflowlist).

```bash
# Download the correct version of the repo
wget https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List/archive/refs/tags/v1.1.2.zip
unzip v1.1.2.zip
cd cd Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List-1.1.2/
pip install .
```

# Data Store
This package downloads a significant amount of background and inventory data (>2.5 GB) in order to process electricity baselines.

The data store for ElectricityLCI is built from the USEPA's [esupy](https://github.com/USEPA/esupy) package (i.e., processed_data_mgmt.py), which uses the definition of a user's non-roaming data directory from [appdirs](https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs).

To see where the data store folder is located on your machine, try running the following in a Python interpreter:

```python
>>> from electricitylci.globals import get_datastore_dir
>>> print(get_datastore_dir())
```

To see what files you have in your data store, you can call the following function and loop through its dictionaries' lists.

```python
>>> from electricitylci.utils import _build_data_store
>>> ds = _build_data_store()
>>> for file_name in ds['electricitylci']['files']:
...     print(file_name)
```

The application folder for this package is 'electricitylci'.

Inventory data is provided by USEPA's Standardized Emission and Waste Inventories ([StEWI](https://github.com/USEPA/standardizedinventories)) package (via stewicombo).
The inventory data associated with StEWI are stored in the application folders, 'stewi' and 'stewicombo'.

Flow mapping is handled using USEPA's Federal Elementary Flow List Python package and is saved in the application folder 'fedelemflowlist'.

The following is an example of the 181 data files downloaded from running the 2020 configuration file (updated in May 2025).
EIA Form 860 Excel workbooks have worksheets that are summarized into CSV files for speed.
Note that once downloaded, these files are referenced (and not downloaded again) unless a different year of data is referenced in a configuration file.

# Developer's Corner

To install the dependencies for this package without installing the package itself, put the following in a text file, called requirements.txt

    fedelemflowlist @ git+https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List#egg=fedelemflowlist
    StEWI @ git+https://github.com/USEPA/standardizedinventories#egg=StEWI
    scipy>=1.10


To checkout a pull request locally for testing:

- Open the pull request in GitHub and find the number associated with it (e.g., [PR\#14](https://github.com/KeyLogicLCA/ElectricityLCI/pull/14)); it should be next to the title.
- Create a new branch (e.g., pr14) and pull the repository changes to your local machine (e.g., `git fetch origin pull/14/head:pr14`)
- Switch to new branch (e.g., `git checkout pr14` or `git switch pr14`)

To see all branches:

- Both local and remote branches are listed using: `git branch -a`

To see changes between two branches:

- See what files are different between your two branches (e.g., `git diff --name-only dev pr14` or simply `git diff --name-only pr14`)
- You can also see who made the changes (e.g. `git log dev..pr14`)
- You can also see differences in a specific file by passing the file path (e.g., `git diff dev pr14 README.md`)

To merge one branch with another:

- With two branches (e.g., 'dev' and 'pr14'), you can merge the changes from one branch into another using the `git merge` command.
- Checkout the branch you want to merge changes in to (e.g., `git checkout dev`)
- Merge all new changes from one branch into the active branch (e.g., `git merge pr14`)
- Or you can merge a single file (e.g., `git checkout pr14 electricitylci/file.py`); note that this copies the file between branches making the local copy look like it does on the other branch.
